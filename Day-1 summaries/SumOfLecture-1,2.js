/*
----> In today's lecture -1 , we talked  about some useful array methods, which are :

 1 - splice() : The slice() method of array  changes the the content of an
 original array by removing or replacing the existing elements or adding.
 
 2 - slice() : It is the same as splice() , but it doesn't change the original array content.
 
 3 - reverse(): It reverse the original array.

 4 - concat() : It concatinate multiple arrays and doesn't change the original array , it makes copy of it.


 5 - join() : join() method is also used , which join the array elements with the space or given value , it doesn't mutate the original array

*/

// Lecture 2
/*
 The new at() method is introduced in ES2022 .
 It is same as array bracket notation.
 By using at() method , we can easily find the last element of array.


 - we had to use some techniques to find the last index element of an array  like , we would do that by  defining  length of an array and subtract it from 1 to find the index or by using slice() method , in which we had to pass -1 as a last index and [0] for loging the element.


 - By using at() method , we simply pass only -1 and it will get the last elemeny of array.

 - we can use it in strings as well.
